# IntroToDataScience_Coaching
I am pleased to share that during my PDENG journey i was selected as a coach for giving a training on data science.

I gave lectures on neural networks;

And i lead a data challenge o healthcare.

DataSet: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.
Attribute Information:

age
sex
chest pain type (4 values)
resting blood pressure
serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
maximum heart rate achieved
exercise induced angina
oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable de
